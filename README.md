# TBSMaker
Game-Tool-Technology for creating and managing Turn Base Strategy Games

The games that TBSMaker pretends to create are of the Diplomacy style: http://diplom.org/Online/maps.html

*Work on progress*

Current TO-DO List:

- To design the whole infrastructure of the game (focusing on an on-going game).
- To create the data structures for player, orders, map and game.
- To create the communication functionality between client and server.
- To create the game loop.
- To create the "resolution" of turn.


DISCLAIMER: 
I'm aware that they do exist other implementations of this type of games online, but I do want to create my own. I intend to expand it to be able to contain different games variants of diplomacy (such as machiavely).

This should be a playground for me, where I can "play" to create various features such as map procedural generation and AI for the game.
